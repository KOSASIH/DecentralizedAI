    Create a Federated Learning Orchestrator (FLO) function.

    This function orchestrates the federated learning process for multiple clients,
    allowing for secure and efficient sharing of data and algorithm updates.

    Args:
    - model: A TensorFlow model to be trained using federated learning.
    - client_data: A list of TFF datasets, one for each client.
    - aggregation_factory: A factory function for creating TFF aggregation functions.
- iterations: The number of federated learning iterations to perform.

    Returns:
    A function that takes no arguments and trains the specified model using federated learning.
