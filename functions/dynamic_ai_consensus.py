def dynamic_ai_consensus(nodes, network, data, threshold=0.6):
    """
    This function implements a Dynamic AI Consensus Algorithm for Decentralized AI.

    It takes as input a list of nodes, a network (represented as a graph), the data to be processed,
    and a threshold value (default 0.6).

    The function returns a dictionary of node IDs with their corresponding decisions and a
    consensus status.

    Each node in the network processes the data and generates a decision for the given task.
    The decisions are then broadcasted to the other nodes in the network.

    The consensus status is determined dynamically based on the threshold value.
    If the average of the top x percentile of decisions is above the threshold,
    the consensus status is set to True.

    If the consensus status is True, the most frequent decision among the nodes is
    returned as the final decision.

    If the consensus status is False, the function returns a message indicating that
    a consensus was not reached.
