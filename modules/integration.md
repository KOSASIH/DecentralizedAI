# Integration Guide

This document outlines the process of integrating DecentralizedAI into an existing application.

# Prerequisites

Familiarity with Python and basic programming concepts
Access to the DecentralizedAI repository

# Getting Started

DecentralizedAI can be integrated as a module into an existing Python application.

# Install DecentralizedAI

To install DecentralizedAI, run the following command:

`pip install decentralizedai`

# Import DecentralizedAI

To import DecentralizedAI into your application, add the following line to the top of your code file:

`import decentralizedai as dai`

# Initialize DecentralizedAI

To initialize DecentralizedAI, call the initialize() function, passing in any necessary parameters, such as the path to the configuration file.

`config_path = "path/to/config.yaml"
dai.initialize(config_path)`

# Use DecentralizedAI

To use DecentralizedAI, call the appropriate functions, such as get_model() or train_model().


`model = dai.get_model("example_model")
results = model.predict(data)`

# Configuration

To configure DecentralizedAI, a configuration file must be created in YAML format.

The following is an example of a basic configuration file: 

[Configuration Example](modules/configuration.yaml) 

In this example, the configuration file sets the project name to "example", specifies the path to the training data, defines a model named "example_model" of type "example_type" with hyperparameters "learning_rate" and "optimizer", and specifies a validation split of 0.2.

Additional configuration options are available, including the ability to specify different data sources, such as a database, and the ability to configure the model training process, such as setting the number of epochs and the loss function.

This document provides a basic overview of the process of integrating DecentralizedAI into an existing application. It covers the prerequisites, getting started, configuration, and further information sections. The integration.md file is intended to be used as a resource for developers who want to integrate DecentralizedAI into their existing applications.

The integration.md file is written in Markdown format, which is widely used for formatting text on the web. The file includes section headers, paragraphs, and lists, as well as code examples for initialization and usage.

The file does not include a glossary section, as the terms used in the document are commonly used in the field of machine learning and data science.

The function code for data processing is provided in a separate file, data_processing.py.

The file does not include a user_guide, as the user guide is provided in a separate file, user_guide.md.

In this example, the configuration file sets the project name to "example", specifies the path to the training data, defines a model named "example_model" of type "example_type" with hyperparameters "learning_rate" and "optimizer", and specifies a validation split of 0.2.
