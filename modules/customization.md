# Configuration File

The main way to customize DecentralizedAI is through the configuration file, which is a YAML file named config.yaml. The configuration file is divided into several sections, and each section contains various parameters that can be modified to change the behavior of DecentralizedAI.

# Global Settings

The global settings section contains parameters related to the overall behavior of DecentralizedAI. These parameters include:

- data_path: The path to the directory where data files are stored.
- log_level: The level of logging detail, ranging from ERROR to DEBUG.

# AI Network Settings

The AI network settings section contains parameters related to the AI network that powers DecentralizedAI. These parameters include:

- nodes: A list of nodes that make up the AI network, defined by their IP address and port.
- weights: The weights assigned to each node in the AI network, based on their relative importance.

# Model Settings

The model settings section contains parameters related to the specific AI models used in DecentralizedAI. These parameters include:

- model_path: The path to the directory containing the model files.
- model_type: The type of AI model, such as a neural network or decision tree.

# Integration Settings

The integration settings section contains parameters related to the integration of DecentralizedAI with other systems and services. These parameters include:

- integration_type: The type of integration, such as a REST API or message queue.
- integration_endpoint: The endpoint of the integration, such as a URL or queue name.

# Customizing Models

DecentralizedAI allows for customization of the AI models used in the system. This can be done in several ways:

- Training new models: Users can train new models using their own data and submit them to DecentralizedAI for use in the AI network.
- Fine-tuning existing models: Users can fine-tune existing models to better fit their specific use case or requirements.
- Creating custom models: Users can create entirely new models from scratch, based on their unique needs and requirements.

# Customizing Visualizations

DecentralizedAI includes several visualization options for data and results, which can be customized to meet the needs of the user. This can include:

- Changing the colors and labels used in visualizations.
- Modifying the layout and positioning of visualizations.
- Adding custom annotations and labels to visualizations.

# Customizing Workflows

DecentralizedAI includes a flexible workflow system that allows for customization of the various stages of the AI process. These workflows can be modified to fit the unique needs of the user, and can include:

- Adding custom stages to the workflow.
- Modifying the inputs and outputs of each stage.
- Changing the order of stages in the workflow.

# Customizing Alerts

DecentralizedAI includes a customizable alert system that can send notifications to users based on certain conditions. These alerts can be customized in several ways:

- Defining the conditions for sending the alert.
- Specifying the message to be sent in the alert.
- Choosing the destination for the alert, such as email or SMS.

# Customizing Integration

DecentralizedAI includes a flexible integration system that allows for customization of the integration with other systems and services. This can include:

- Defining the data format for the integration.
- Specifying the mapping between DecentralizedAI data and external data.
- Customizing the integration endpoint or protocol.
